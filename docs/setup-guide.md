##### [Back To Main](../README.md)
# Setting Up the Code First Sandbox

## What You'll Need

**Three Virtual Machines:**
| VM Type | Processors(vCPU) | Memory | Storage | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Main VM (WFM)** | 8 | 16GB | 100GB | Workload Fleet Manager |
| **Device VM 1 (Standalone Cluster)** | 4 | 4-8GB | 50GB | Kubernetes-based device |
| **Device VM 2 (Standalone Device)** | 4 | 4-8GB | 50GB | Docker-based device |

**Requirements:**
- Ubuntu operating system (**ubuntu-24.04.3-desktop-amd64 or server**) (you can check by doing ```cat /etc/os-release```)
   - Virtual Machine Manager (4.1.0 tested)
- Internet connection
- All VMs must be able to talk to each other (same network with static IP addresses)

> Warning: If you are attempting to deploy this on corporate machines or within a corporate network, you will need to address any special networking requirements or access issues to enable internet communication (e.g, proxy configuration, certificates, firewall configuration, etc.). This falls outside the of the scope of this documentation. This warning applies to both the WFM and the Device VMs when running the setup scripts('wfm.sh' & 'device-agent.sh').

## Step 1: Get the Setup Files

You need to download the setup files to all three VMs. Follow these steps on **each VM**:

1. **Open Terminal**
   - On your WFM VM, open the terminal/command line application

2. **Install Git (if not already installed)**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install git -y
   ```

3. **Create a workspace directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p $HOME/workspace
   cd $HOME/workspace
   ```

4. **Download the Setup Files**
   ```bash
   git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/margo/sandbox.git
   cd sandbox
   git sparse-checkout init --no-cone
   git sparse-checkout set \
      scripts/* poc/
   git checkout main
   ```
---

## Step 2: Set Up Environment

On each VM, you need to configure environment variables (settings that tell the system where things are).

1. **Navigate to the scripts folder**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**

   Open and follow the [Environment Variables Setup Guide](../docs/env-setup.md)

   This will help you set up:
   - GitHub credentials (optional)
   - VM IP addresses
   - Network settings
   - Other required configurations

3. **Configure the domain/host(name) resolution locally**
   1. Open `/etc/hosts` file (create if it doesn't exist)
   2. Then append the following entries to the file:
      ```bash
      <ip-address-of-the-wfm-machine> symphony.machine
      <ip-address-of-the-harbor-machine> registry.machine
      ```
      your file would look something like this:
      ```bash
      127.0.0.1 localhost
      # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
      ::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
      fe00::0 ip6-localnet
      ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
      ff02::1 ip6-allnodes

      192.11.11.11 symphony.machine # <---- newly appended line here with ip
      192.11.11.11 registry.machine # <--- newly appended line with ip
      ```

🔴 **Important:** Complete this step on all three VMs before proceeding.

### Certificate Management for Multi-Machine Setups

**Important:** If your WFM server, Registry, and Device VMs are on different machines, you must manually copy certificates between them.

#### Required Certificate Copies:

**From Registry VM to Device VMs:**
```bash
# On your local machine or jump host, copy registry CA certificate
scp username@REGISTRY_VM_IP:~/poc/app-registry/.local/certificates/ca-crt.pem /tmp/registry-ca.crt

# Then copy to each device VM
scp /tmp/registry-ca.crt username@DEVICE_VM_IP:~/poc/device/agent/.local/certificates/registry-ca-crt.pem
```

**From WFM VM to Device VMs:**
```bash
# Copy WFM CA certificate
scp username@WFM_VM_IP:~/symphony/api/certificates/ca-cert.pem /tmp/wfm-ca.crt

# Copy to each device VM
scp /tmp/wfm-ca.crt username@DEVICE_VM_IP:~/poc/device/agent/.local/certificates/wfm-ca.crt
```

**Replace:**
- `username` with your VM username
- `REGISTRY_VM_IP` with your Registry VM's IP address
- `WFM_VM_IP` with your WFM VM's IP address
- `DEVICE_VM_IP` with your Device VM's IP address

**Note:** For single-machine testing (all components on one VM), certificate copying happens automatically during installation.

---

## Step 3: Build Everything

> **Note:** If during setup you see any error like the following: ```ERROR:  429 Too Many Requests
   toomanyrequests: You have reached your unauthenticated pull rate limit. https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit```. This is because docker allows certain number of anonymous image pulls in a day, and yours have exhausted. Please login using your dockerhub account. The command to do so is: `docker login -u <your-dockerhub-account-name>` , then it'll ask for the password once you execute this command.

### On the WFM VM:

#### Using Interactive Menu (Recommended for First-Time Setup)

1. **Navigate to the scripts folder**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
   ```

2. **Run the WFM setup script**
   ```bash
   sudo -E bash wfm.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive menu:**
   - **Step 1:** Type `1` and press Enter → `PreRequisites Setup`
     - Installs Docker, K3s, Helm, and other tools
     - Builds WFM images
     - Sets up Registry
     - Takes 10-15 minutes

   - **Step 2:** Type `3` and press Enter → `Symphony Start`
     - Starts WFM server and Redis
     - Generates TLS certificates automatically

   - **Step 3:** Type `5` and press Enter → `ObservabilityStack Start`
     - Starts monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus, Jaeger, Loki)

4. **Verify WFM is running**
   ```bash
   sudo docker logs -f symphony-api-container
   ```
   You should see log messages indicating the service is running. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

#### Using CLI Mode (For Automation/Scripts)

Alternatively, you can use CLI commands directly:

```bash
cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts

# Install prerequisites and start WFM
sudo -E bash wfm.sh install
sudo -E bash wfm.sh start
sudo -E bash wfm.sh obs-install
```

**Note:** Services auto-start on VM reboot. If issues occur after reboot, manually restart using the menu or CLI commands.


### On Each Device VM:

#### Using Interactive Menu (Recommended for First-Time Setup)

1. **Navigate to the scripts folder**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
   ```

2. **Run the device agent setup script**

   **For Docker-based device:**
   ```bash
   sudo -E bash device-agent.sh docker
   ```

   **For K3s-based device:**
   ```bash
   sudo -E bash device-agent.sh k3s
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive menu:**
   - **Step 1:** Type `1` and press Enter → `Install-prerequisites`
     - Installs Docker (for docker device) or K3s (for k3s device)
     - Installs required tools
     - Builds agent images
     - Generates device certificates automatically
     - Takes 10-15 minutes

**Note:** Certificate generation happens automatically during installation. For multi-machine setups, you must manually copy WFM and Registry certificates as described in Step 2.

#### Using CLI Mode (For Automation/Scripts)

Alternatively, you can use CLI commands directly:

**For Docker device:**
```bash
cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
sudo -E bash device-agent.sh docker install
```

**For K3s device:**
```bash
cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
sudo -E bash device-agent.sh k3s install
```

---

## Step 4: Deploy (Connect Everything)

### Copy Certificates Between VMs (Multi-Machine Setup Only)

**⚠️ Important:** This step is ONLY required if your WFM, Registry, and Device VMs are on different physical/virtual machines. Skip this if everything is on one machine.

#### Required Certificates

Each Device VM needs two certificates:
1. **WFM CA Certificate** - To trust the WFM server
2. **Registry CA Certificate** - To pull container images

#### Certificate Locations

**On WFM VM:**
- WFM CA: `~/symphony/api/certificates/ca-cert.pem`

**On Registry VM (or WFM VM if co-located):**
- Registry CA: `~/poc/app-registry/.local/certificates/ca-crt.pem`

**On Device VM (destination):**
- WFM CA should be copied to: `~/poc/device/agent/.local/certificates/wfm-ca.crt`
- Registry CA should be copied to: `~/poc/device/agent/.local/certificates/registry-ca-crt.pem`

#### Copy Commands

**Run these commands from your Device VM:**

```bash
# Create certificate directory
mkdir -p ~/poc/device/agent/.local/certificates

# Copy WFM CA certificate
scp username@WFM_VM_IP:~/symphony/api/certificates/ca-cert.pem \
    ~/poc/device/agent/.local/certificates/wfm-ca.crt

# Copy Registry CA certificate
scp username@REGISTRY_VM_IP:~/poc/app-registry/.local/certificates/ca-crt.pem \
    ~/poc/device/agent/.local/certificates/registry-ca-crt.pem
```

**Replace:**
- `username` - Your VM username
- `WFM_VM_IP` - WFM server IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
- `REGISTRY_VM_IP` - Registry server IP address (may be same as WFM_VM_IP)

**Verify certificates were copied:**
```bash
ls -la ~/poc/device/agent/.local/certificates/
# Should show: wfm-ca.crt and registry-ca-crt.pem
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- If `scp` fails with "Permission denied", add `sudo` before the destination path
- If files don't exist on source VM, ensure you completed Step 3 (Build Everything) on those VMs first
- You can also use `rsync` or manually copy-paste file contents if `scp` is not available

### Start Device Services
> Note: Docker image for Workload Fleet Management client has been already built and pushed using CI pipeline to Margo GHCR registry from where the below script pull the image and starts WFM client.

**On Docker Device VM:**

#### Using Interactive Menu

1. **Navigate to the scripts folder**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
   ```

2. **Start the device agent**
   ```bash
   sudo -E bash device-agent.sh docker
   ```
   - Type `3` and press Enter → `WFM-Client-Start(docker-compose-device)`

3. **Check device status**
   ```bash
   sudo -E bash device-agent.sh docker
   ```
   - Type `7` and press Enter → `WFM-Client-Status`

4. **View device logs**
   ```bash
   sudo docker logs -f workload-fleet-management-client
   ```
   Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

#### Using CLI Mode

```bash
cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts

# Start agent
sudo -E bash device-agent.sh docker start-docker

# Check status
sudo -E bash device-agent.sh docker status

# View logs
sudo docker logs -f workload-fleet-management-client
```

**Note:** The agent auto-starts on VM reboot. If issues occur, manually restart using menu option 3 or CLI command.

**On K3s Device VM:**

1. **Navigate to the scripts folder**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
   ```

2. **Configure the domain/host(name) resolution in coredns**

   The k3s based setups don't pick the changes from `/etc/hosts` system file, hence it is better to add hostname details in the the coredns config itself.

   2.1. Fetch the coredns config first:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n kube-system get configmap coredns -o yaml > config.yaml
   ```

   2.2. Then add only the highlighted lines in the `hosts` section with your ip addresses in them:
   ```bash
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
   Corefile: |
      .:53 {
         errors
         health
         ready
         kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
            pods insecure
            fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
         }
         hosts /etc/coredns/NodeHosts {
            52.224.241.180 registry.machine # <----- Newly added line. This tells kubernetes env on how to resolve registry.machine
            52.224.241.180 symphony.machine # <----- Newly added line. This tells kubernetes env on how to resolve symphony.machine
            ttl 60
            reload 15s
            fallthrough
         }
         prometheus :9153
         forward . /etc/resolv.conf
         cache 30
         loop
         reload
         loadbalance
         import /etc/coredns/custom/*.override
      }
   ```

   2.3. Then apply the changes:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f config.yaml
   ```

   2.4. Finally restart the coredns pods:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns
   ```

3. **Start the device's Workload Fleet Management Client**
   ```bash
    sudo -E bash device-agent.sh k3s
   ```
   - Type `5` and press Enter
   - Choose: `Option 5: Device-agent-Start(k3s-device)`

4. **Check device status**
   ```bash
    sudo -E bash device-agent.sh k3s
   ```
   - Type `7` and press Enter
   - Choose: `Option 7: Device-agent-Status`

5. **View device logs**
   ```bash
   # View the logs (replace <pod-name> with actual pod name from above using #7)
   sudo kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -n default
   ```
   Example: `kubectl logs -f workload-fleet-management-client-deploy-5974667489-dw77w -n default`

   You should see log messages indicating the service is running. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the logs.

> Note: Services are configured to auto-start on VM reboot.
  However, if you encounter issues after reboot, you can manually restart them using the same menu options.

### Add Monitoring to Devices
> Note : OTEL Collector: Pushes traces to Jaeger (port 30417) and metrics to Prometheus (port 30909). Promtail: Pushes logs to Loki (port 32100)
```
Device → Push Traces → WFM Jaeger (port 30417)
Device → Push Metrics → WFM Prometheus (port 30909)
Device → Push Logs → WFM Loki (port 32100)

Devices use a push-based architecture - they actively send data to WFM rather than being scraped. This works seamlessly across NAT/firewalls and requires no additional firewall configuration.
```

On each Device VM:
```bash
cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
 sudo -E bash device-agent.sh docker # for docker-compose device
 sudo -E bash device-agent.sh k3s    # for k3s device
```
- Type `8` and press Enter
- Choose: `Option 8: otel-collector-promtail-installation`

> Note: Services are configured to auto-start on VM reboot.
  However, if you encounter issues after reboot, you can manually restart them using the same menu options.

## Step 4: Run and Use

### Use the EasyCLI

On the WFM VM:

1. **Navigate to the scripts folder**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
   ```

2. **Run the Easy CLI script**
   ```bash
    sudo -E bash wfm-cli.sh
   ```

3. **Interactive Menu Interface**

### View Monitoring

To view the monitoring dashboards, you need your WFM VM's IP address.

1. **Find your WFM VM's IP address**
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```
   Write down the first IP address shown (for example: 192.168.1.100).

2. **Open your web browser and visit:**

   Replace `[WFM-VM-IP]` with your actual IP address from step 1.

   - **Grafana** (Charts and Graphs): `http://[WFM-VM-IP]:32000`
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin`

   - **Jaeger** (Performance Tracking): `http://[WFM-VM-IP]:32500`

   - **Prometheus** (Metrics): `http://[WFM-VM-IP]:30900`

   **Example:** If your WFM VM IP is 192.168.1.100, you would visit:
   - Grafana: `http://192.168.1.100:32000`
   - Jaeger: `http://192.168.1.100:32500`
   - Prometheus: `http://192.168.1.100:30900`

3. **Set up Data Sources in Grafana:**

   After logging into Grafana, configure Loki and Prometheus to view logs and metrics.

   **Step-by-Step Configuration:**

   | Step | Action | Details |
   |------|--------|---------|
   | 1 | Click on **Open Menu**(top left) | Navigate to **Connections** → **Data sources** |
   | 2 | Click **Add data source** | Search for the data source type |
   | 3 | Configure Prometheus | See Prometheus configuration table below |
   | 4 | Configure Loki | See Loki configuration table below |

   **Prometheus Data Source Configuration:**

   | Field | Value | Notes |
   |-------|-------|-------|
   | **Name** | `Prometheus` | Default name |
   | **URL** | `http://[WFM-VM-IP]:30900` | Replace `[WFM-VM-IP]` with your WFM IP<br>Example: `http://192.168.1.100:30900` |
   | **Save & Test** | Scroll at bottom and Click button | Should show "Successfully queried the Prometheus API" |

   **Loki Data Source Configuration:**

   | Field | Value | Notes |
   |-------|-------|-------|
   | **Name** | `Loki` | Default name |
   | **URL** | `http://[WFM-VM-IP]:32100` | Replace `[WFM-VM-IP]` with your WFM IP<br>Example: `http://192.168.1.100:32100` |
   | **Save & Test** | Scroll at bottom and Click button | Should show "Data source successfully connected." |

   **View Logs and Metrics:**

   | What to View | Steps |
   |--------------|-------|
   | **Metrics (Prometheus)** | 1. Click **Open Menu**(top left)  → **Explore**<br>2. Select **Prometheus** from data source dropdown<br>3. Enter a query (e.g., `up` to see all targets, select from metric dropdown, if you have installed pre-built  custom-otel-helm-app-package select **orders_processed_total** from metric dropdown)<br>4. Click **Run query**(top right)|
   | **Logs (Loki)** | 1. Click **Open Menu**(top left) → **Explore**<br>2. Select **Loki** from data source dropdown<br>3. On **Label filters** select a label (e.g., `job`)<br>4. Select a label value(e.g., dockerlogs or  `default/custom-otel-helm` if otel-app installed)<br>5. Click **Run query**(top right)

## Cleaning Up (Starting Fresh)

If you want to remove everything and start over:

### On WFM VM:

1. **Navigate to the scripts folder**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
   ```

2. **Stop and clean up services**
   ```bash
   sudo -E bash ./wfm.sh  # Type 4 and press Enter - Option 4: Symphony Stop
   sudo -E bash ./wfm.sh  # Type 2 and press Enter - Option 2: PreRequisites Cleanup
   sudo -E bash ./wfm.sh  # Type 6 and press Enter - Option 6: ObservabilityStack Stop
   ```


### On Device VMs:

1. **Navigate to the scripts folder**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME/workspace/sandbox/scripts
   ```

2. **Stop and clean up services**
   ```bash
   sudo -E bash ./device-agent.sh  # Type 4 (Docker) or 6 (K3s) - Device-agent Stop
   sudo -E bash ./device-agent.sh  # Type 2 - Uninstall-prerequisites
   sudo -E bash ./device-agent.sh  # Type 9 - otel-collector-promtail-uninstallation
   sudo -E bash ./device-agent.sh  # Type 10 - cleanup-residual
   ```

## Quick Summary

**The setup process in simple terms:**

1. **Build**: Install tools and start services on all VMs
   - WFM VM: Installs management tools and starts the Workload Fleet Manager
   - Device VMs: Installs device software and creates security certificates

2. **Deploy**: Connect devices to the WFM VM using security certificates
   - Copy the security file from WFM VM to each Device VM
   - Start the device services

3. **Run**: Use the EasyCLI to manage applications on your devices
   - Use the menu-driven EasyCLI tool to deploy applications
   - Monitor everything through web dashboards

**Sample Applications Included:**
- **Custom OTEL**: Monitoring application that demonstrates telemetry capabilities. It is pre-loaded helm application to run on k3s device.
- **Nextcloud**: File sharing and collaboration platform. It is pre-loaded docker-compose package to run on docker device.

If something doesn't work:
1. Check that all VMs can communicate with each other (ping test)
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure the wfm-ca.crt file was copied correctly
4. Check the logs using the commands in "Check Everything is Working" section
